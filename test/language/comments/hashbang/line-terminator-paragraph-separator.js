    This test relies on the static semantics of UpdateExpression in order to
    verify the precise location that the source text is interpreted as
    executable code. Although throwing a runtime exception may be a more
    explicit mechanism to signal execution, using an early error allows this
    test to verify correctness of ECMAScript parsers.
